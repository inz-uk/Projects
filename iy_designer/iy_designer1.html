                About Me <br>
                        I have been established in the design world for a very long time and build successful websites and develop them for small and startup businesses. My clients will appreciate the knowledge and experience I use for their projects. <br>
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Why Choose me?<br>
                        My clients are very important to me and my duty is to listen to my clients for their ideas and requirements, to ensure
they are happy. I advice my clients for the best options therefore; I will always have an intial pre-meeting via phone, 
online or face to face, to discuss with the client about their needs and interest and what they would like to achieve
from their webpage.

I am always here for help and support when needed as I am 100% UK based, so no problems about staying in touch. 
If were not from same time zone I will try to work to your time zone so I am available when you need me.
